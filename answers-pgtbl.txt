I'm not sure what questions should I answer?
So I simply fill this file with some bullshits.

My version of pgaccess is not that perfect, since I used an uint64 buffer to send back the bitmask after checking the test file and find out
the bitmask is retrived with a unsigned int variable. However, I guess that without stating how many pages will be checked(the second argument),
I have no great method to pass the bitmask back(with first page corresponding to the least significant bit as required) other than passing them
one bit by another.
